h1. About

TestFlight is a tiny single-file demo application showcasing all the features and usage of the "Pilot":http://github.com/countvajhula/pilot graph operator. Take a look at the code directly (TestFlight.groovy) to understand the basic usage of Pilot.

h2. To run the app via Maven (with dependencies managed):

$ mvn clean install
$ mvn exec:java

You can make changes to the code and run it again with the above commands.

h2. To run without Maven:

You'd have to make sure all the dependency JARs (Pilot, Blueprints, Gremlin, your chosen graph database) are present in your classpath. Then simply run as:

$ chmod +x TestFlight.groovy
$ ./TestFlight.groovy
